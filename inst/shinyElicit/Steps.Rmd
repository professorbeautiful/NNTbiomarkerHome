***Step 1. Clinical scenario*:** The purpose of the biomarker test is to Prognosis of cutaneous T cell
lymphoma (CTCL). In early stages of CTCL, patients (Stages IA-IIA)
usually do well and have slowly progressive disease, which does not
require aggressive therapy associated with substantial side effects.
However, about 15% of these patients have unexpected progressive course
and rapid demise.


***Step 2.  Principal goal:*** To identify, among `r input$who`, who should receive 
**`r Option_1`** and who should receive **`r Option_2`**.

***Step 3.  Clinical benefit:*** A biomarker progression risk model
that is able to classify patients into high and low risk groups will
enable personalized and more aggressive therapy for the patients at
highest risk for progression.

***Step 4. Classification performance needed:*** Regarding more
aggressive therapy upfront, the PI stipulates that the classifier will
have clinical utility if the “number needed to treat” (*NNT*) is less
than *NNT<sub>Lower</sub>* = 2 in the test-positive patients, and greater than
*NNT<sub>Upper</sub>* = 30 in the test-negative patients. Then 2 patients testing
positive will need to receive aggressive treatment upfront in order to
treat one patient who otherwise would suffer later rapid progressive
CTCL, while in the test-negative patients one would have to treat an
unacceptably high 30 patients to treat one patient in advance of
progressive CTCL. This performance should suffice to create a clinical
consensus supporting using the test for clinical decisions.

***Step 5. Prospective study requirements***: The values
*NNT<sub>Lower</sub>*= 2 and *NNT<sub>Upper</sub>*= 30 correspond to the positive
predictive value *PPV* = 50% = 1/*NNT<sub>Lower</sub>*, and the negative
predictive value *NPV* = 97% = 1 – 1/*NNT<sub>Upper</sub>*. We will be able to
recruit 40 patients in this early-stage group, over 3 years, with a
minimum of 2 years follow-up thereafter. If the test divides the 40
patients into roughly 25% positive and 75% negative, and the estimates
match the hoped-for values 2 and 30, the confidence intervals would be
19% to 81% for *PPV*, and 83% to 100% for *NPV*, or equivalently^24^
1.23 to 5.35 for *NNT<sub>Pos</sub>*, and 5.81 to 1180 for *NNT<sub>Neg</sub>*. The very
wide confidence interval for *PPV* is due to the low sample size and low
prevalence combined with the low value for *NNT<sub>Pos</sub>*, which is strongly
weighted towards avoiding unnecessary aggressive therapy. To obtain a
more accurate and independent estimate of *PPV* , we also plan a
retrospective study.

***Step 6. Retrospective study requirements:*** Combining *PPV* and
*NPV* with an incidence of rapid progression of 15%, the required
sensitivity (*SN*) and specificity (*SP*) are 83.3% and 85.3%,
respectively (contra-Bayes Theorem). To get a sense of the accuracy of
anticipated estimates in the retrospective (case/control) portion of the
study, we consider anticipated results for samples sizes 22 cases (the
entire complement of early stage CTCL who rapidly progressed) and 40
controls. For example, if the estimates *SN*=18/22 = 82% and
*SP*=34/40=85% are observed, then the corresponding confidence intervals
will be 60%–95% for *SN*, and 70%–94% for *SP*, and Bayes predictive
intervals will be (1.4, 2.7) for *NNT<sub>Pos</sub>* , and (16.4, 87.8) for
*NNT<sub>Neg</sub>* . (These intervals derive from assuming independent Jeffreys
priors for *SN* and *SP*, sampling from joint independent posteriors
incorporating the anticipated results, and applying Bayes theorem).
